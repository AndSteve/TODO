#### Dummy static pages
- Make a landing page for your todo items, index.php
  - index.php will be the landing page for all operations, all other pages will be included within it
- Make a directory for all of your template pieces, called "template"
  - Create dummy static php pages for your template pieces
    - templates/header.php - main navigation and logo for the site
    - template/footer.php
- Make a directory for all of your sub-pages called "pages"
  - Create dummy static php pages of the following:
    - pages/display_item.php - displays all of the data from 1 todo item
    - pages/list_all_items.php - Shows all todo items in a list structure
    - pages/create_todo_item.php - create a single todo item
    - pages/login_template.php - page to log the user in
- In index.php, load the appropriate page based on the $_GET superglobal key 'current_page'

#### DO NOT spend a lot of time styling them.  You may put in basic bootstrap.  The purpose of this is to get the basic skeleton
