# TDL
To Do List

# Version .5
- in your header.php file
  - Provide the following links:
  - If Logged out:
    - Login - log the user in
  - If logged in:
    - View : view todo list
    - Create: create new todo item
    - Logout - log the user out
- in your index.php page:
  - include the PHP page based upon the clicked link above (view and create)
- Add basic functionality to your todo-list project to based upon the dummy data objects you created in .2
    - read whole list and show summary data for available items
    - read individual todo-list item and show it specifically
    - create new data.
        - This will eventually send data to the server
        - For now it will simply append the data to the existing list
